ANNOUNCEMENT.</h2></div>


<p>The Trustees of the John F. Slater Fund propose to publish from time to
time papers that relate to the education of the colored race. These papers
are designed to furnish information to those who are concerned in the administration
of schools, and also to those who by their official stations are
called upon to act or to advise in respect to the care of such institutions.</p>

<p>The Trustees believe that the experimental period in the education of
the blacks is drawing to a close. Certain principles that were doubted thirty
years ago now appear to be generally recognized as sound. In the next
thirty years better systems will undoubtedly prevail, and the aid of the
separate States is likely to be more and more freely bestowed. There will
also be abundant room for continued generosity on the part of individuals
and associations. It is to encourage and assist the workers and the thinkers
that these papers will be published.</p>

<p>Each paper, excepting the first number (made up chiefly of official documents),
will be the utterance of the writer whose name is attached to it,
the Trustees disclaiming in advance all responsibility for the statement of
facts and opinions.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A REPORT CONCERNING THE COLORED
WOMEN OF THE SOUTH.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">To the Board of Trustees<br />
<span class="gap">of the John F. Slater Fund.</span></span></p>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>:&mdash;We have the honor to submit the following
report of a recent tour (made at the request of your Board)
for the purpose of ascertaining the condition, mental and
moral, of the colored women of the South.</p>

<p>We started on October 20th, 1895. Our tour was confined
to the five Central States,&mdash;Virginia, North and South Carolina,
Georgia and Alabama. We visited twenty-four schools and
institutions, examined the life of the people in the one-roomed
cabin of the plantation and road-side, in the hovels of the
manufacturing towns, as well as the neat and attractive homes
which are the result of industry and thrift aided by education.
We conversed with colored clergymen, lawyers, doctors, druggists,
artisans, cotton-factors and laborers, with male and
female teachers in educational and industrial schools, with
trained nurses and servants, with wives and mothers, and with
girls in and out of the schools.</p>

<p>If the conclusions we draw should seem optimistic, it should
be remembered that we received our impressions from negroes
at their best, in the five states we visited, as most of them
under thirty years of age have come under the influence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the great schools which have been established by northern
philanthropy.</p>

<p>We found the graduates of these schools<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> intelligent, modest,
self-respecting, clear sighted and frank in regard to the shortcomings
and defects of their race, and while grateful for all
that has been done for them, anxious to help themselves, and
full of confidence and hope for the future. Among those not
actually in the schools we found the desire for education and
for the decencies of life to be intense, and parents appear to
be willing to make the greatest sacrifices to secure for their
children better advantages.</p>

<p>But the negro women of the South are subject to temptations,
of which their white sisters of the North have no appreciation,
and which come to them from the days of their race enslavement.
They are still the victims of the white man under a
survival of a system tacitly recognized, which deprives them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of the sympathy and help of the Southern white women, and
to meet such temptations the negro woman can only offer the
resistance of a low moral standard, an inheritance from the
system of slavery, made still lower from a life-long residence
in a one-roomed cabin.</p>

<p>Remove a girl early from such degrading environment, send
her home to her people with the changed idea of personal
decency acquired by residence at one of the training schools,
and she becomes at once a powerful agent for good in her
family and neighborhood. Dr. Curry, the able Secretary of
the Slater and Peabody Trusts, says:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of the desire of the colored people for education the
proof is conclusive, and of their capacity to receive mental
culture there is not a shade of a reason to support an adverse
hypothesis.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_2_4" id="FNanchor_2_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_4" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>It was a great surprise to us to learn that, at all the schools
we visited, the pupils (except in the state schools) pay from
five to seven dollars a month for board and tuition. Those
who cannot pay, work ten hours a day for the privilege of two
hours schooling in the evening. It was in this way Booker
Washington obtained his education, working his way one
hundred miles to reach Hampton. The day scholars in two
rural schools we visited in the black belt of Alabama paid
one dollar a month for their tuition for eight months, as the
state only pays, on an average, thirty dollars a month to a
teacher for three months, and provides neither school-house
nor books.</p>

<p>Where, we ask, do we find among the well-to-do working
classes of the North, to say nothing of the poorest, such an
effort to educate their children? Of the moral effect of the
education so obtained there seems to be no question.</p>

<p>The leaders of the race say, &#8220;all we ask is time and a fair
chance,&#8221; and judging of their future by their past since the
emancipation, we think they are right. We were surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
at their clear judgment and general information about their
people, at their freedom from malice, and kindly feeling
toward the whites, and in this connection we may quote a
conversation with Mr. Chavis, a negro graduate of Gammon
Theological Seminary, and in charge of the Bennet School at
Greensboro, N. C. He says:</p>

<p>&#8220;The whites complain that the educated negro declines
&#8216;hired work&#8217; and that education is ruining him. Those men
who have acquired a profession or trade, or learned how to
cultivate the land on scientific principles, refuse to enter the
employ of the whites at six or eight dollars a month, because
independently they can earn more, and then the whites say
&#8216;there is a negro spoiled by education.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The girls who graduate from the schools have acquired
knowledge which enables them to support themselves at good
wages until they marry, which they generally do five years
after they graduate, generally to the men with whom they
have been educated. If they by chance go into domestic
service, they get from four to six dollars a month, and are
treated as in the old slave days, which they naturally resent;
they therefore seek independent occupations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about their morals?&#8221; we asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can confidently assert, that of the girls I have educated
very few have gone astray, and in the face of temptations to
which the whites are not subjected. We teach them it is a
part of their duty in life to encourage and guide their ignorant
sisters. We strive in this school to found our education upon
a strong Christian basis, and we feel that God has already
blessed our work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What occupations are open to your young people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The men become clergymen, doctors, lawyers, apothecaries
and teachers. Many of the trades are now open to them,
thanks to the industrial schools. They are buying land, and
through the education they obtain at Hampton and Tuskegee
they are cultivating it more intelligently. They have not as
yet gone much into business, owing to the want of capital.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>&#8220;In the practice of the professions you mention, are they
employed by the whites?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly at all; but we are eight millions of people, and
that is a nation in itself, so that we are independent in that
respect, though no doubt in time the whites will become accustomed
to seeing us occupying positions requiring education
and intelligence, and will employ us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do your best pupils come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the rural districts. The girls and boys from the
country are more anxious to learn, more diligent and ambitious.
They turn out better than those from the towns,
who are lazy, and are always longing for diversions and
&#8216;<i>fascinating frivolities</i>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>From Mr. and Mrs. Satterfield (white), of Scotia Seminary,
N. C., we received similar replies to the same questions.
Mr. Satterfield said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We have been here many years, and I have carefully
followed the lives of my girls after they have left, and I can
safely say that I can count on the fingers of one hand those
who have gone astray. As a rule they marry within five years
after they graduate, and their chief ambition is to have comfortable,
Christian homes. As they generally marry the young
men who have had educations like their own, both work for
the same object. In fact,&#8221; he added, &#8220;the character and
intelligence of the negro, like the whites, is the result of
environment and heredity, and these factors produce corresponding
results upon each.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this opinion all the white teachers we saw agreed, from
Hampton to Montgomery, without exception. We also learned
that the teachers discover no difference in mental capacity
between the Afro-Americans of pure blood and those who
have an admixture of white blood.</p>

<p>At Tuskegee, Mrs. Booker Washington gathered, from
within a radius of seven miles, about thirty married women
that we might talk with them, and hear about their lives.
Some of them walked seven miles to meet the &#8220;Northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Ladies,&#8221; and they ranged in age from thirty to seventy years.
None had less than five children, and one had had nineteen.
Their husbands were all laborers. Some few owned
their land and houses, though most of these were so heavily
mortgaged as to give them no chance to get ahead, interest
sometimes running as high as 20 per cent. Their stories
reminded us of the accounts that have come from Russia of
the oppression of the peasants by the Jews, which led to the
edicts of expulsion of the latter by the late Czar.</p>

<p>These women, however, had all come under the influence
which Mr. and Mrs. Booker Washington exercise at Tuskegee.
They are striving to have more decent homes, to educate their
children, and to get out of debt. They have taken the first
step toward elevation; they have learned what is better, and
are willing and anxious to work for it.</p>

<p>The negro problem of which we hear so much does not
seem to us as difficult to solve as the labor problem of the
North, complicated as that is by the mixture of races and religions.
The negroes, on the contrary, are a homogeneous race,
Afro-Americans, knowing no other country than the United
States, and desiring no other; agricultural in their habits and
tastes, intensely attached to the soil, loyal to the government,
and mostly Protestant in faith, except in Louisiana and parts
of Florida.</p>

<p>The Afro-American to-day in the five central Southern
States is not so degraded or ignorant as was the French peasant
before the revolution of 1792. In fact he is less degraded,
for while his poverty and ignorance are no greater, he is not
unjustly oppressed nor weighed down by taxation.</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur Young, whose account of his travels in France
on the eve of the revolution is quoted authoritatively by historians,
states:<a name="FNanchor_3_5" id="FNanchor_3_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_5" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> &#8220;Husbandry is not much further advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
than among the Hurons, and the people almost as wild as their
country. Their houses brutally filthy, no windows, no other
light than the door, mud floors and chimneys. The people
can neither read nor write, girls and women terribly ragged,
if possible worse clad than with no clothes at all. All without
shoes and stockings. People so ignorant that they know
nothing of their own weights and measures.&#8221;</p>

<p>From this deplorable condition, the French peasant has
risen in a hundred years to be the most thrifty, industrious
and intelligent agriculturist in Europe.</p>

<p>With this example before us, one may reasonably expect,
judging from his progress in the last twenty-five years, that
the Afro-American, by the middle of the 20th century, may
stand side by side with the other races now crowding into the
Republic. We were told at Hampton that the students who
now apply for entrance are nearly as advanced as those who
graduated twenty years ago, and at the Scotia School for girls
they are commencing to receive the daughters of their first
graduates, and find these know nearly as much on entering as
their mothers did when they left.</p>

<p>In 1890, only a generation after they were emancipated,
not less than forty-three out of every hundred negroes of ten
years of age and over were able to read and write. In 1870
only three per cent. of all negroes attended school, and in
twenty years the increase was nearly nineteen per cent. of all
negroes. The proportion of negro school children increased at
a far more rapid rate than white school children, and in 1890
the proportion was nearly equal.<a name="FNanchor_4_6" id="FNanchor_4_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_6" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In 1877-78 the attendance in private institutions was 12,146;
in 1894-95 the attendance was 25,717.<a name="FNanchor_5_7" id="FNanchor_5_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_7" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>But help from the North must still continue, and if possible
increase. Matters have not yet so adjusted themselves in the
South as to warrant the leaving the educational interests of
the colored race altogether to the hands of the Southern whites,
and the negroes instinctively turn to the Northern teachers for
education and guidance, notwithstanding the large appropriations
made for schools by the Southern whites.</p>

<p>The leaders of the race, both white and black, are now alive
to the importance of industrial education, and most of the
schools we visited had introduced manual labor of various
kinds as a part of the curriculum, and where it had not been
done the additional expense had been the obstacle. Everywhere
we found the strongest desire on the part of a large
number of girls to learn the profession of nursing, and those
who have already acquired it have been very successful, the
whites willingly employing them at high wages&mdash;from $10 to
even $20 a week. Some schools already announce a course
of training, but they seem to be unaware that a nurse can no
more be trained without a hospital, than a cook without a
kitchen. We found but two training schools attached to hospitals
during our travels, the Dixie at Hampton, which is doing
excellent work and should be assisted in order to strengthen
and extend it, and that at Spelman, Atlanta, where there is a
small hospital in which they nurse their own sick under an
excellent Superintendent, and have already sent out some
nurses with satisfactory results, and would be glad to extend
the work if they could receive assistance in paying teachers.</p>

<p>In Savannah at a meeting where we met nineteen of the
leading colored men of the place, they assured us of their
ability to start a small hospital, if they could be assisted in
the salaries of teachers to train the pupil nurses. None ask
support, merely help.</p>

<p>Several of the schools we visited require just a little
help to make them very prosperous and useful. Those at
Lawrenceville, Va., and Kittrell, N. C., managed by Hampton
graduates, are especially to be commended and should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
strengthened. A good nursing school might be established
at Mr. Joyner&#8217;s school at Columbia, S. C., where they have
a little hospital, closed for want of means. Five hundred
dollars given to Claflin would enable it to do the same work.
Especially would we urge assistance to the two rural schools
in the black belt of Alabama, where Hampton and Tuskegee
graduates are bravely toiling and truly civilizing the people
around them.</p>

<p>As we have said, we saw the negroes at their best in the
institutions we visited, and among those graduates who were
pursuing their avocations. These served to show the possibilities
of the race, their aptitude for acquiring knowledge and
amassing property. But the great mass still lies under the
burden of poverty and ignorance&mdash;and it is this mass that
must be lifted up, before we can hope for any permanent elevation
of the race,&mdash;and that must be done by work in the
cabins and among the women. It is impossible to look for a
moral community, where the women have never been taught
by example and precept that Christian virtue which raises the
human being above the animal.</p>

<p>It is perhaps unwise at this time to give full expression
to our views regarding the moral condition of the negro
women. It is sufficient to say that the reports that had
been made to us by others, before we undertook our investigations,
were fully confirmed, and we hope that in the near
future the women of the South will become so interested and
roused to the importance of the subject that they may be
inclined to cooperate with the women of the North in some
plan for the elevation of these descendants of their former
servants. Meanwhile, we would make the following suggestions
to the Trustees of the Slater Fund in regard to the
special object of our mission&mdash;the elevation of the women:</p>

<p>The elevation should commence at the bottom. We would
propose to employ pious, intelligent women, white or colored,
to travel in the rural districts of say Virginia and Alabama,
and to start Mothers&#8217; meetings, where the average ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
woman, who cannot now hope to receive an education, may at
least be taught the way to keep a decent home and to elevate
the moral standard of her humble life. Through her to inspire
her husband and children with the same aspirations, so that if
there be no public school in their vicinity they may both learn
to desire and seek to obtain one started by the State. The
State should then be districted, and two or three central schools
in each district should be so aided as to give courses of lessons
in sewing, cooking, and &#8220;First Aid to Injured.&#8221;</p>

<p>These branches of instruction, so vital to woman, might be
taught by teachers of each branch (paid by the Slater Trust)
passing from school to school, giving a course of lessons at
each, and leaving the pupils to pursue the study until the
teachers return to examine them. These examinations would
enable the teacher to determine the capacity of the girls and
their fitness to be sent to the higher schools, where many now
go when unfitted to enter and occupy places which should be
filled by girls of superior ability. By this process of selection,
the most intelligent and ambitious could enter Hampton, Tuskegee,
Spelman, etc., while those of less ability will have
learned the decencies of life, the elements of school education,
and those feminine occupations which will fit them to be good
wives and mothers.</p>

<p>By giving them courses in &#8220;First Aid,&#8221; they will learn
how to act in sudden emergencies, the importance of cleanliness
and good air, and the general principles of caring for
their sick and their children.</p>

<p>The kind of work we propose to do cannot be done by the
State at present. It is personal influence that is required; it
is the highest missionary spirit which can alone inspire it.
No board of education appointed by any Government or State
authority can choose such agents. Each woman who undertakes
it, must go for the love of the work, and must be selected
by those who know its needs. The money so liberally expended
by the North would never have produced the results
we have seen, if it had been given to the State; it is because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
it has passed through the hands of devoted Christian men and
women who by precept and example have taught the beauty
of honor, truthfulness and purity of life, that the speech was
made possible at Atlanta, which elicited the applause and drew
tears from the thousands who listened to it.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we would respectfully urge the appropriation
by the Slater Trust of a few thousand dollars to be expended
for a few years as an experiment in the manner we have
suggested. If the work is carefully supervised, we are convinced
that it will be of incalculable value in enlarging the
opportunities for self-support and usefulness among the rising
generation of colored girls, and, through them, influence for
good thousands of the colored race.</p>
